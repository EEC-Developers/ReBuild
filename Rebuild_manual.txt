                      Rebuild - Reaction GUI Builder
                               Version 1.2.0

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Introduction

Rebuild is a GUI builder for the reaction user inteface system. Reaction is
part of the Amiga OS for all versions from 3.2 and above. Reaction started
out as a product called ClassAct which was later enhanced and turned into
Reaction.

ClassAct had a GUI builder program called ClassMate (developed in 1997)
which was shareware and only freely available in demo form which had
severly limited functionality. I used ClassMate as a design template when
I made Rebuild. It has a similar look but the code is entirely new.

It includes support for many more gadget types than ClassMate did and has
been improved in many ways to allow for easier use.

Just a few of the improvements are:

1) Support for both E and C languages
2) Menu design is shown in the preview window
3) Support for multiple windows in a single project
4) Copy buffer making it easier to move or duplicate gadgets 
5) More flexible system of arranging gadgets and layouts
6) Multi-level undo/redo
7) Realtime code preview

2. License

The program is released into the public domain for anyone to use however
they wish with no restrictions apart from that the program should not be
sold for profit.

You may use this program to assist with the development any application
without restriction however use of this project is entirely at your own
risk. I will not accept responsibilty for any issues arising from the
use of Rebuild.


3. Using Rebuild

Upon loading Rebuild you will be presented with the main working window of
the GUI designer. GUI designs in Rebuild are built using a hierarchical
structure represented as a tree layout in the main window. You will also
see a preview window where you will see an accurate representation of your
current GUI design.

Initially you will be presented with a default design that has a single
window and a root layout gadget. You can add/remove windows from your
design using buttons in the toolbar at the bottom or by using the menus.

The toolbar buttons are context sensitive, so if you select the window
node in the tree view and press the 'Add' button it will add a new window.
If you have selected a layout or any other gadget, selecting 'Add' will
allow you to add more gadgets to your design.

The default window layout starts with a vertical layout gadget. Any
gadgets added to this will be displayed stacked vertically. You can change
this in the gadget properties (double click on the layout in the tree
structure).

You can create complicated layout designs by breaking them down into
smaller parts and using layouts within layouts to denote the arrangement
of horizontal or vertical within that layout area.

If you wanted to create a screen similar to this:

.--------------------.  .-------.
|                    |  |  Ok   |
|    ListView        |  '-------'
|                    |  .-------.
|                    |  | Canel |
`--------------------'  `-------'
.-----. .------. .----. .-------.
| Add | | Edit | | Up | |  Down |
`------ `------  `----' `-------'

You could create it using an arrangement like this:

        Layout - Vert
          Layout - Horiz
            ListBrowser Object
            Layout - Vert
              Button Object
              Button Object
          Layout - Horiz
            Buton Object
            Buton Object
            Buton Object
            Buton Object

There are some example files included in the examples folder.

In addition to the layout control there are two other gadget types that
can have child controls added to them. The ClickTab gadget and the Virtual
gadget.

The ClickTab gadget displays tabs according to its list (see list manager
section below). In addition it can also support different pages of controls
for each tab. Child gadgets are added to a ClickTab control in exactly the
same way as they are added to a layout control. Each child control will
be displayed in a different tab. Typically you would add a layout control
to the ClickTab for each tab. Then you can build up a UI design for that tab
by adding further child controls to each layout.

The Virtual gadget displays a group of gadgets within a scrollable area.
You can display a larger number of gadgets than would normally be visible
in the window by allowing the user to scroll around the virtual area. The
virtual gadget allows only one child control to be added directly. That
would typically be a layout control in order that further gadgets can
be displayed within the virtual scroll area.

You can also control the screen settings that are using for your GUI design
and add menu definitions for each window. You can also specify a set of
Arexx commands. The screen settings and Arexx commands will not affect how
the design works in Rebuild but they will be included in the source code
that you generate.

Note:

The TextField gadget is not a Reaction gadget and is not included by defaullt
in OS 3.2. You should avoid using this gadget. It was included in the
original ClassAct library but was not carried forwards into the Reaction
implementation. The stand alone textfield gadget can be downloaded from
the Aminet here:

http://aminet.net/package/dev/gui/textfield

If you use this gadget in your GUI design and it is not installed on your
system you will only see a placeholder graphic in the preview window.
If you generate code and attempt to run that code on a system where the
TextField gadget is not installed it will fail on startup.


4. The list manager

Some of the gadget types (List Browser, Chooser, RadioButton and ClickTab)
require a list of items to function. You can set up any number of lists
in the list manager and add items to those lists. Once this is done you can
add them to a gadget. You can add the same list to more than one gadget.

If you need to go back later and modify the list, it can easily be edited
in the list manager even after it has been added to a gadget.


5. The copy buffer

On the right side of the main window you will see the copy buffer.
Using the buttons below you can copy or move items from the main design
window into the copy buffer. This is highly useful if you want to
duplicate a gadget several times with the same settings or move a gadget
from one window to another in your design.

6. The code window

Rebuild is able to generate fully working SAS C and Amiga E code for the
GUI designs you create. The code preview window will show the source code
for the current design. The source code is updated in real-time as you
make changes. If you wish to save the source code there is an option on
the file menu. You can also close the source code window if you do not
wish to see it. Even if the source window is closed you will still be
able to save the source code.

The source code will be based upon the code generation options as
explained in the next section.

In order to compile the source code you will need the Amiga OS 3.2 NDK.
The E-VO E compiler has this as standard so I recommend if you plan to use
the E source code then I recommend you use this.

If you are using C then the NDK can be obtained from the aminet
http://aminet.net/package/dev/misc/NDK3.2

Compiling the E or C source should not require any additional libraries or
includes than the ones present in the NDK and as part of the OS.

You may also be able to use the resulting code with older versions of the OS
if you have ClassAct installed - although it should be noted that despite
the ClassAct documentation stating that it works with OS2.0 and above, it is
my experience that it does not actually work with anything below OS 3.0


7. Source code generation options

When you click the 'Code' button you will be presented with 4 options:

   1. E or C source
   2. Use ids for GA_ID / Use array index for GA_ID
   3. Generate full code / Generate definitions only
   4. Use NDK Macros in definitions

The first option is pretty self explantory. You can pick between E or C
language and the GUI design will be exported to a code file in that language.

The last option will determine whether the resulting code will be a complete
working example that can be compiled. If you compile and run the code you
will be presented with a window very similar to the preview window shown in
Rebuild. The code generated can then be expanded to include any logic you
need to form your application.

If you choose 'Generate definitions only' then the resulting code will not
be complete and is intended for you to copy and paste the GUI definitions
into an application source file.

The second option controls how the GUI code is constructed and will impact
on the value used for the GA_ID property for each gadget. When you are
coding the message processing loop for your application the GA_ID values
will be important for you to identify the gadget that is sending the
message.

IF you choose to 'Use ids for GA_ID' then each gadget will have a GA_ID
value based upon its unique ID allocated by Rebuild. every item in the GUI
design gets a unique ID and these will never change (unless you delete the
gadget). Even after you delete a gadget the old ID will never be re-used.

This means you are free to reference these ID's in your custom code and
you don't have to worry that changing the GUI design and re-generating the
code will mean you have to re-write your code.

If you choose to use the option 'Use array index for GA_ID' then the GA_ID
for each gadget will be numbered sequentially from 0 for each window.
This means that it is simpler to handle the coding to manage the GUI because
you can always use the ID as an index into the gadgets array generated in
the code but it does also mean that if you rearrange the GUI design in any
way then the GA_ID values will change and if you have hard code any of these
values into your custom code then it will need to be re-coded.

There is more information regarding this in the next section.

Finally the option to use NDK macros or not alters the code generator and
if the option is enabled then you will see something like this in the code

         LAYOUT_AddChild, main_gadgets[button_10] = ButtonObject,
           ...
           ...
         ButtonEnd,
         
ButtonObject and ButtonEnd are macros defined in the NDK. Many of the
gadgets have such macros defined but they do not work well with the GCC
compiler. So we have given the option to generate code that does not use
them.

When the macros are disabled you will instead see code that looks like this:

        LAYOUT_AddChild, main_gadgets[button_10] = NewObject(BUTTON_GetClass(),NULL,
          ...
          ...
        TAG_END),

This option has been added partly to allow for user preference in generated
code but also because GCC does not handle these macro's correctly unless
additional compile options are specified. So this gives the user the option
to generate code that does not use these macros. The alternative for GCC is
to use the -DNO_INLINE_STDARG parameter when compiling.


8. Tips on working with the rebuild generated source code.

Here is an example of some C code generated by rebuild. I have annotated it
with some comments to explain the intended use of some of the parts of the
code. The generated code is only intended as a possible starting point for
the application. In order to make the application functional there will be
a lot of additional coded needed to drive the GUI.

Rebuild is not designed to be a fully functional development environment,
it is purely a GUI design tool. If you use this code structure as a basis
for your application, it would be recommended that you try to separate
your custom code from the auto-generated code as much as possible in
order to reduce the amount of rework needed if you change the GUI design
and have to regenerate the code.

9. Tooltype settings

Some of the defaults for the Rebuild application can be configured by
editing the Rebuild.info file.

Many of these settings are also saved into your project file, so if you
reload the file it will also restore the state of the settings you had
last used.

Here is a list of the tooltypes that can be defined

   LANG=E / C        (controls the default language shown)
   USEIDS=YES / NO   (code export default setting)
   FULLCODE=YES / NO (code export default setting)
   USEMACROS=YES / NO(code export default setting)
   CODEPATH=         (select the default path for the code save)
   SAVEPATH=         (select the default path for project save)
   SHOWBUFFER=YES / NO (show the copy buffer at startup)
   SHOWSETTINGS=YES / NO (show settings when adding new gadgets)
   PROJECTICONS=YES / NO (create an icon for project files)
   WARNONDELETE=YES / NO (Warn when an item is deleted)
   PREVIEWCODE=YES / NO (Show code preview window at startup)
   WINDOWTOP = 
   WINDOWLEFT =
   WINDOWWIDTH =
   WINDOWHEIGHT = (override the main window size and position)

   CODEWINDOWTOP = 
   CODEWINDOWLEFT =
   CODEWINDOWWIDTH =
   CODEWINDOWHEIGHT = (override the code preview window size and position)


10. Futher inforation

ReBuild is written using my own E-VO compiler.

The full source code is available on gitgub:
https://github.com/dmcoles/ReBuild

If you find any issues with this product please do feel free to raise an
issue in the gitgub repo or if you wish to contact me for any reason
regarding this project please do.

Michael Bergmann has put in a lot of time and effort in testing Rebuild and
has also developed a tutorial for Rebuild. This tutorial goes into depth
regarding the use of Rebuild and each of the gadget types.

There have been some changes to this tool since that tutorial was written
so the tutorial may not fully reflect the current workings of the current
version.

The tutorial is available separately from gitub repository:

https://github.com/dmcoles/ReBuild/tree/main/tutorial

My thanks go to Michael for this great work.


11. Future (possible) enhancements

I have many ideas for future enhancements to this project. My plan was to
release something which could at least cover all of the functionality of
the old ClassMate tool for the first version of Rebuild.

Just a few of my ideas (some of which may or may not be possible) are:

   * add more languages to the code generator
   * option to generate codecraft project files
   * add hint text to the settings pages to help users

11. Version history

  1.0.0
    - Initial release
  
  1.1.0

      in the version of E-VO used to compile 1.0.0)
    - About dialog changed 'Rebuilder' To 'Rebuild'
    - Loading a bitmap with no image selected reported an incorrect error
    - Added option to generate code that does not use macros in the object
      definitions (for better GCC compatibility).
    - add GA_TabCycle property to click tab
    - code generated for fuel gauge now uses GA_Text instead child label
    - fuel gauge used incorrect default number of ticks
    - GetScreenMode did not include child label in generated code
    - Glyph did not include child label in generated code
    - Glyph used incorrect default type
    - Added USEMACROS tooltype
    - Sketchboard was missing many of the settings in the generated code
    - SizeBRight and SizeBBottom did not work correctly in preview window

    - add 'move into vlayout' and 'move into hlayout' menu options
    - implement reopen function
    - add hint text option to all gadgets
    - rename incorrect window gadget help label
    - set window gadget help to default to true
    - window activate flag defaults to true
    - adding new gadget now inserts after currently selected gadget instead
      of at the end
    - add menu keyboard shortcuts
    - add undo/redo capability
    - save code preview and preview window positions to project file
    - update project file format to v2
    - add tooltype options for code previews and code preview window position
    - settings saved to envarc:
    - add realtime code preview window
    - set selected item to root layout for new project
    - make main window and code preview window remember their last positions
    - add preview window width + height properties
    - add link to vscroll to text field gadget
    - add link to hscroll and link to vscroll to text editor gadget
    - add link to slider gadget for integer gadget
    - add horizontal scroll flag to texteditor
    - throw an error on startup if neither textfield or texteditor gadgets
      are present
    - all gadget types now have label property
    - set preview window settings based on window definition
