# ReBuild
Amiga Reaction GUI Builder (Remake of ClassMate)

ClassMate was a graphical user interface builder for ClassAct
for the Amiga in 1997. ClassAct was developed into Reaction which is
now part of Amiga OS 3.2. ClassMate however was a shareware product
and in its demo form was severely limited.

There was no save functionality. Popups appeared every few minutes
and it was limited to a small number of objects that could be placed.

The full version of ClassMate is no longer available and for that reason
I decided to make my own GUI builder for Reaction. It is heavily based on
the look of ClassMate is all written from scratch. It includes support
for many more gadget types than ClassMate did and has been improved in
many ways to allow for easier use.

Just a few of the improvements are:

1) Support for both E and C languages
2) Menu design is shown in the preview window
3) Support for multiple windows in a single project
4) Copy buffer making it easier to move or duplicate gadgets 
5) More flexible system of arranging gadgets and layouts

ReBuild is written using my own E-VO compiler.

The program is released into the public domain for anyone to use however
they wish with no restrictions apart from that the program should not be
sold for profit.

You may use this program to assist with the development any application
without restriction however use of this project is entirely at your own
risk. I will not accept responsibilty for any issues arising from the
use of Rebuild.
